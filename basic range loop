#Read an integer . For all non-negative integers i< N, print i sqrd. 

n = int(input())
for x in range(n):
   print(x**2)
   
#Could be done using a comprehension as well
print(*[x**2 for x in range(n)], sep='\n')

* before the bracket is there to unpack each

Could be written as this as well
[print(i**2) for i in range(n)]
